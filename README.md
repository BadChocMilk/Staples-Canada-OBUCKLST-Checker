# Staples OBUCKLST Checker/Comparator 
I made this because I was really annoyed with checking and comparing two lists every week. The best part about being a computer scientist is you can develop something to do what you're too lazy to do yourself. This was a project mostly made for me, but I see no reason as to why anyone else couldn't use it, so feel free!

Please do not be afraid to report any issues or contribute in any way, this is kind of a rushed job, I basically did it in one afternoon on my own time, so there are bound to be some mistakes.

# How to use?
Using it is fairly straightforward. The openbox list from the OBUCKLST will need to be completed at least once. After that, the previous OBUCKLST and the current one can just be uploaded, no fomatting or anything done to it, and it will do its job.

There is also an option to check for the verified list, so that items that still need to be verified can easily be checked. Same process as openbox, but  click "verify" instead. Uses the current OBUCKLST selection.

Now supports "Negative News"! If there is any negative onhands, it will display how many, as well as which list those negatives may come from. Adjustments can be made accordingly.
